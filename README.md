## Weather-Report-in-PowerBI

##  Overview

This project presents a  Weather and Air Quality Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI.
The dashboard provides real-time and forecast-based insights into weather conditions and air quality across cities in Gujarat, enabling better environmental awareness and informed decision-making.

The data is sourced from weather APIs, transformed using Power Query, and analyzed using DAX measures.

## Objectives

* Monitor current weather conditions across multiple cities
* Analyze short-term (7-day) weather forecasts
* Track air quality levels and pollutant concentration
* Assess potential health risks using AQI indicators
* Enable city-wise comparison for environmental analysis

## Tools & Technologies

* Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* API-based Data Sources

## Data Preparation & Modeling

* Imported raw weather and air quality data into Power BI
* Cleaned and transformed datasets using Power Query
* Created calculated measures using DAX, including:
  * Air Quality Index (AQI)
  * Pollutant concentration metrics
  * Forecast-based summaries
* Optimized the data model for efficient filtering and interaction

## Dashboard Features

* Current Weather Overview
* Weather Details
* 7-Day Weather Forecast
* Sunrise & Sunset Analysis
* Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

## Key Insights

* Weather conditions vary significantly across the three cities
* High rainfall probability observed during forecast periods
* AQI occasionally reaches unhealthy levels for sensitive groups
* Specific pollutants contribute more prominently to AQI variation
